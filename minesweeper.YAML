  Minesweeper is single-player logic-based computer game played on rectangular board whose object
  is to locate a predetermined number of randomly-placed "mines" in the shortest possible time by 
  clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with mines. If the player clicks on a 
  mine, the game ends.
